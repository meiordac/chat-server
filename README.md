Chat server using Node, Express, Typescript, Socket.io, gulp, and Heroku.

# Socket.io

Used Socket.io, a realtime abstraction library which helps my app serve users without WebSocket support. Socket.io also provides common functionality like rooms, namespaces, and automatic reconnection. 

Socket.io is one of the fastest and most reliable realtime engines.
